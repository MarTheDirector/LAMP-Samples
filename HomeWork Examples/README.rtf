\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello to whomever this concerns. In this you will find material related to my current project FAIT app. The content provided is not up to date. It is work prior to a complete redesign/rebranding of my application. This work consists of the original UI/UX design which is flawed in many ways. These flaws are changed in my current project which I am willing to show/discuss if I am interviewed. You will also find to folders labeled \'93FAIT\'94. One in the directory iOS/FAIT. Which is my first original Xcode swift 1.2 built and seniorYear/phonegap/faittho, there\'92s a phone gap version of this same project.}
