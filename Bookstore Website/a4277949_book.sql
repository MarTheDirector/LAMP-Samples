They did, and the new semantics are being used by major sites like eBay and IMDB right now. In chapter seven you\'ll be brought up to speed on one of the biggest changes to semantics to ever hit the web.</li><br/> \r\n<li>Learn what HTML5 features you can implement today HTML5 isn\'t one big blob of technology that will be \"finished\" at some point in the future. It\'s a grab bag of cool stuff, much of which has been around for years. Learn what\'s well supported and ready to go today in 2012, including new forms features in chapter eight, and the new audio and video possibilities in chapter ten.</li><br/> \r\n<li>Learn what happens when Flash dies The writing is on the wall for Flash. Apple never supported it on mobile; Adobe (Adobe!) have given up on the plug-in for Android; and Microsoft won\'t support it in IE10 in the default desktop experience of Windows 8. (Let that sink in for a moment.) Clients will demand HTML5 equivalents of what was done with Flash so we\'ll look at what HTML\'s Canvas can do in chapter nine and what HTML5 video can (and can\'t) do in chapter ten.</li><br/> \r\n<li>HTML5 for CMSs, and beyond HTML5 Finally in chapter twelve we\'ll look at some of the web app oriented features of HTML5, one of which (the History API) changes something as fundamental as a page refresh. We\'ll also touch on features that we should be demanding asking politely to be included in our CMSs, and we\'ll look briefly at some post-HTML5 web standards development for mobile that\'s becoming a reality right now.</li></ol>'),(11,'HTML5: The Missing Manual','Matthew MacDonald','0448673215','9780738451511','O\'Reilly Media','2011',450,'23.68','HTML5 is more than a markup language-it\'s a dozen independent web standards all rolled into one.

You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your web pages over time so they work in all browsers and mobile devices. Oh, and if you\'ve never heard of CSS, that\'s okay--we won\'t tell anyone you\'re still partying like it\'s 1999--but if you\'re going to create web pages in the 21st century then you\'ll want to know and understand CSS.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nLearn the real secrets of creating web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWith Head First HTML, you\'ll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages.
